# README

This is a basic c# app made during learning C# :)

It reads a file, parses the json content and prints to console.

The code is somewhat clean and can easily be extended to parsing other types of data than json,
and handling other types of objects than "Games".

## Running

```
1. dotnet run
2. When prompted for a file path, enter data/games.json
```
